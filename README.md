## Exercise Topics

### Exercise 1: Exploring Gradient Method
In this exercise, I delved into the gradient method, a fundamental optimization technique widely used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The primary objective of this exercise was to investigate the impact of the step parameter, also known as the learning rate, on the performance and behaviour of the gradient method when applied to various functions.

### Exercise 2: Exploring Evolutionary Algorithms
Exercise 2 focuses on evolutionary algorithms, a class of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution. I examined their concepts, strengths, and implementation. I focused on visualizing how each parameter such as mutation or crossover probability, population size and generations count effect performance in optimizing more complex problems such as Rastrigin, Griewank and Drop-Wave functions.

### Exercise 3: Implementing Minimax Algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Exercise 3 involves the implementation of the Minimax algorithm for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
